# search-controlled-vocabularies
DataONE’s Arctic Data Center project on controlled vocabularies concerning ecosystem concepts.
Project Goals include: 
Compiling relevent "external" vocabularies and intergrating them into the current ECSO ontology 
Identifying poorly constructed vocabularies to incorporate 
Constructing new relevant vocabularies to support the existing database holdings 
Provide user-testing and feedback on DataONE's annotations and search tools during archiving Synthesis data products
